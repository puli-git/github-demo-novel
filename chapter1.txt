Chapter1
 It was 2:00 AM when Leo found himself standing on the empty train platform, the chill of the early morning air biting at his skin. He glanced down at his watch, wondering if he had somehow missed it. But there it wasâ€”an old, forgotten train, parked in the distance with its lights flickering as though it had been waiting for him. He had no reason to be there, yet something inside him urged him to climb aboard.
e there, yet something inside him urged him to climb aboard.
e there, yet something inside him urged him to climb aboard.
e there, yet something inside him urged him to climb aboard.
e there, yet something inside him urged him to climb aboard.
